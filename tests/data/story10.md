### User Story 10: Implement Product Recommendation Engine

AS A Customer  
I WANT to see personalized product recommendations  
SO THAT I can discover relevant items that match my preferences and needs.

**User Perspective:**  
The customer wants the shopping experience to be tailored to their interests, making it easier to find products they are likely to purchase without extensive searching.

**Business Narrative:**  
A recommendation engine increases average order value, improves conversion rates, enhances customer satisfaction, and provides valuable insights into customer preferences and behaviors.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

*   The system displays personalized recommendations on the home page, product pages, and cart page.

*   The system displays "You May Also Like" suggestions based on the current product category.
*   The system shows "Complete Your Look" recommendations for fashion items.
*   The cart page displays relevant add-ons and complementary products.

*   Recommendations dynamically update based on user interactions during the session.
*   The system excludes products the customer has already purchased recently.
*   The system provides a brief explanation of why items are being recommended.
*   The recommendation algorithm improves over time through machine learning.
