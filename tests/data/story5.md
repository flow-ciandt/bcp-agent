### User Story 5: Implement Two-Factor Authentication

AS A User  
I WANT to enable two-factor authentication on my account  
SO THAT my account has an additional layer of security.

**User Perspective:**  
The user wants to protect their sensitive information by adding a second verification step beyond just a password when logging in.

**Business Narrative:**  
Implementing 2FA reduces security incidents, builds customer trust, helps with compliance requirements, and ultimately reduces support costs related to account recovery.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

*   The user can navigate to security settings in their account.
*   The user sees an option to enable two-factor authentication.
*   The system supports multiple 2FA methods (SMS, email, authenticator app).
*   When enabling 2FA, the system guides the user through the setup process.
*   For app-based authentication, the system displays a QR code for scanning.
*   The user must verify the 2FA setup by entering a code before completion.
*   The system provides backup recovery codes for the user to download.
*   Once enabled, subsequent logins require both password and 2FA verification.
*   The user can disable 2FA through account settings after identity verification.
*   The system logs all 2FA-related activities for security audit purposes.

**UI Elements:**

*   Security settings page
*   2FA toggle switch
*   Authentication method selection radio buttons
*   Step-by-step setup wizard
*   QR code display
*   Code verification input field
*   Recovery codes display and download button
*   Success/error notification messages

**External Integration Points:**

*   SMS gateway service
*   Email service
*   Time-based one-time password (TOTP) algorithm
*   Security logging system
*   QR code generation service
