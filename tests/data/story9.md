### User Story 9: Implement Social Sign-In

AS A New User  
I WANT to sign up using my social media accounts  
SO THAT I can create an account quickly without filling out registration forms.

**User Perspective:**  
The user wants a frictionless onboarding experience with minimal effort, leveraging existing accounts to avoid creating and remembering another set of credentials.

**Business Narrative:**  
Social sign-in reduces registration abandonment rates, increases sign-up conversion, provides access to additional user data (with consent), and enables social sharing features.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

*   The sign-up page displays options to register with email/password or social accounts.
*   The system supports sign-in with at least three major providers (Google, Facebook, Apple).
*   When selecting a social sign-in option, the user is directed to authenticate with the provider.
*   The system requests appropriate permissions from the social provider.
*   After authentication, new users are prompted to review and accept terms of service.
*   New users are asked to provide any additional required information not available from the social account.
*   The system creates a new user account linked to the social identity.
*   Returning users are automatically logged in when using social sign-in.
*   Users can link multiple social accounts to their existing account.
*   Users can unlink social accounts while maintaining at least one authentication method.
*   The system handles gracefully when social providers are unavailable.

**UI Elements:**

*   Sign-up/login page
*   Social provider buttons with logos
*   Permission request dialog
*   Terms of service acceptance checkbox
*   Additional information form
*   Account linking interface in user settings
*   Error messages for failed authentication

**External Integration Points:**

*   OAuth2 implementation
*   Google Sign-In API
*   Facebook Login SDK
*   Sign in with Apple
*   User database system
*   Session management system
*   Error tracking service
