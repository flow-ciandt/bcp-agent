### User Story 6: Implement Dark Mode

AS A User  
I WANT to switch between light and dark display modes  
SO THAT I can use the application comfortably in different lighting conditions.

**User Perspective:**  
The user wants to reduce eye strain when using the application in low-light environments and have control over the visual appearance of the interface.

**Business Narrative:**  
Implementing dark mode enhances accessibility, demonstrates attention to user experience, follows industry best practices, and may reduce battery consumption on OLED devices.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

*   The user can find a display mode toggle in the application settings.
*   The toggle allows switching between "Light," "Dark," and "System Default" options.
*   Selecting "System Default" makes the application follow the device's theme setting.
*   The application's theme changes immediately when the setting is changed.
*   All screens and components must have appropriate dark mode styles.
*   Text maintains readability in both modes with proper contrast ratios.
*   The user's preference is saved and persists between sessions.
*   The application loads with the last selected theme or system default.

**UI Elements:**

*   Settings menu
*   Theme toggle or dropdown selector
*   Preview of theme appearance
*   Save preferences button
*   Visual feedback when theme changes

**External Integration Points:**

*   Device theme detection API
*   Local storage for user preferences
*   CSS/theme framework
