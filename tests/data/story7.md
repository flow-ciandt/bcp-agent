### User Story 7: Implement Batch Order Processing

AS A Warehouse Manager  
I WANT to process multiple customer orders simultaneously  
SO THAT I can improve fulfillment efficiency and meet shipping deadlines.

**User Perspective:**  
The warehouse manager needs to handle high volumes of orders during peak periods and wants to reduce the time spent processing each order individually.

**Business Narrative:**  
Batch processing capabilities significantly increase operational efficiency, reduce labor costs, minimize human errors, and improve order fulfillment times, ultimately enhancing customer satisfaction.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

*   The warehouse manager can select multiple orders using checkboxes in the order management interface.
*   The system provides a "Process Batch" button when multiple orders are selected.
*   The manager can filter and sort orders before selecting them for batch processing.
*   The system validates that selected orders can be processed together (same fulfillment center, compatible statuses).
*   The system displays a confirmation dialog showing the number of orders and estimated processing time.
*   The system processes all selected orders in the background with a progress indicator.
*   The system generates consolidated picking lists grouped by warehouse zones.
*   The system updates all processed orders' statuses simultaneously.
*   If any orders fail processing, the system provides detailed error information.
*   The system maintains an audit log of batch processing activities.
*   The system can handle batches of up to 500 orders without performance degradation.

**UI Elements:**

*   Order list with selection checkboxes
*   Batch action button
*   Filter and sort controls
