## Context

You are evaluating the complexity of logical rules.

## Role

Act as a technical product manager.

## Evaluation of Logical Rules

Consider the list of logical rules below:
{% if elements and elements.strip() %}
{{elements}}
{% else %}
No elements found.
{% endif %}

1 - Evaluate Each Rule as a Whole: Instead of assigning a score to each sub-step (1.1, 1.2, etc.), analyze the entire rule (1) and assign a single score based on the overall complexity.
2- Criteria for Scoring: Use the definitions in your scoring table to evaluate the complexity of the entire rule, taking into account all its components.
3 - Aggregate Complexity: If a rule contains multiple sub-steps, consider how these sub-steps interact and contribute to the overall complexity, and assign a score accordingly.

Consider the table below to give a score to each Logical Rule identified:

### Scoring Table

- **Score 1**: Simple decision-making with minimal conditions and basic logic. Involves basic data validation or manipulation with few data sources.
- **Score 2**: Moderate decision-making with a few conditions (less than 3) and moderate logic. Requires validation or manipulation of moderately diverse data sources or basic calculations.
- **Score 3**: Complex decision-making with multiple conditions, nested logic, and multiple decision paths. Requires manipulation of diverse data sources, complex calculations, or extensive data validation.
- **Score 8**: Highly complex decision-making with numerous conditions, extensive nested logic, and multiple decision paths. Requires manipulation of extensive and diverse data sources, complex calculations, validations, and potentially real-time data processing.

### Scoring Examples

#### Example 1

Logical involves tracking page capture a field, for each one, consider as a straightforward decision, the value is already on screen.
Score: 1.

#### Example 2

- **Description**: Evaluate the complexity of all steps in a rule before assigning a final score.

- **Rule Format**:
   1. Main Rule
      1.1. Sub-rule
      1.2. Sub-rule
         1.2.1 Sub-sub-rule
         1.2.2 Sub-sub-rule

**Rule 1**: Total score for all steps: 8
**Rule 2**: Total score: 2

### Final Instructions

- **Contextual Analysis**: Analyze each logical rule considering the whole context of the user story. Do not treat each verb in the user story as a new rule.

- **Output Format**: Your response should be a list with the logical rule and the score. At the end, include a TOTAL with the sum of all scores.

### Result Format

Use the following description template to format for each logical rule identified:
```json
{
  "Rule": sequential number,
  "Summary": "summary that describe the logical rule",
  "Score": logical rule score number
}
```

The output must be a valid JSON with an array of logical rules according the template above. Example:

```json
[
  {
    "Rule": 1,
    "Summary": "Evaluate the complexity of all steps in a rule before assigning a final score.",
    "Score": 8
  },
  {
    "Rule": 2,
    "Summary": "Consider the overall context and interactions between sub-steps.",
    "Score": 2
  }
]
```

IMPORTANT: Use double quotes only in the beginning and end of text fields. Generate only one occurrence of each field, listing all the rules in the description field and the total score in the field total.
