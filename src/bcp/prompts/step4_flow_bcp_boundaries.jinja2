The Business Complexity Points ruler is the tool that you use to measure the Complexity Size. It defines the criteria for determining and normalizing the complexity of software. It was created with the intention of being a single, simple and objective model, in addition to being stable and unchangeable over time. It is based on universal aspects of business and software engineering and is completely decoupled from technical aspects, such as the architectural solution or technology used. 

The ruler has complexity items that correspond to each perspective that can influence the complexity of a story in the backlog and each of the complexity items has size options ranging from XS to XXXL, with their respective weights on the Fibonacci scale.
An important detail that we can observe in the structure of the ruler is that it has some empty spaces or N/A (Not Applicable), which means that, for a given complexity item, there is no possibility of scoring for that corresponding size, thus ensuring that a point has the same weight, regardless of the perspective from which it was captured.

The analysis process consists of identifying complexity items and analyzing the occurrence of each of these complexity items for a given story. The sum of the points results in the functional complexity of the story. Note that different people using this technique should arrive at the same result, at any given moment in time, and if they do not, the ruler itself can be used to clarify and eliminate these differences. And in my experience, in most cases, this difference in score occurred due to a divergence in the understanding of the functional scope.

This is how you analyze each Boundaries Complexity Items:

The boundaries perspective seeks to evaluate the interactions that a backlog item has with data sources or destinations, where information traffic occurs. Examples of interactions include sending information about an application's domain to another or receiving information about the domain of another application. The same can happen between applications and devices in the physical world, such as printers and hard drives.

Just as with the limits and borders between countries, it is fundamental in the analysis of this perspective to have clarity about where the boundaries of the application in which the backlog item is inserted lie. From this definition, we can identify, in the commercial relationship between countries, which borders are crossed, assuming that each country represents an application, and with which other countries (applications) there is a commercial relationship of import or export of goods (information).

When we talk about software, the rationale is exactly the same, but we talk about the digital environment (applications) or the physical environment (devices) instead of countries, and information exchanges instead of goods. Note that when we evaluate boundaries, we are quantifying the different physical or digital media involved in the exchanges. Therefore, if we communicate more than once with the same medium, we will cross the same border several times.

Going back to the example of countries, if we import different types of raw materials and varied electronics to the same country, we consider that we have only one commercial relationship, at a single border.

Identifying the boundaries:
- Importing and exporting files;
- Interactions with data sources to send business information;
- Reading information from sensors in real time.

Regarding boundaries, we can state:
- It seeks to evaluate the interactions that a backlog item has with data sources or destinations, in which information traffic occurs.
- If there is an exchange of information with two distinct physical devices, we will have two occurrences of the Borders item.

Tips:
- Count once for each new boundary identified.
- Be clear about the system boundary.
- Webservice being only a technical solution is not an m/xl boundary.

Examples:
- Example of rule XS: CRUD screen with access to the database.
- Example of rule S: Generation of XLS file in a report in a WEB application.
- Example of rule M: A WEB application with access to the external geolocation identification service.
- Example of rule XL: Sending XML to SEFAZ.

The Complexity Sizes of Boundaries and their Points can be determined by the following correspondence between size and characteristics and definition of each size:
[
  {
    "Complexity Item": "Boundaries",
    "Size Definition": "DB and/or UI or do not cross boundaries (self-contained) or not identified.\n\nOwnership:\nType: Full ownership.\nDescription: The system completely owns the data and interactions, with no external dependencies.\n\nValidity:\nType: Internal validation.\nDescription: Validations are performed within the system, ensuring data integrity without external checks.\n\nDurability:\nType: Persistent.\nDescription: Information is stored and maintained within the system for future access.",

Notes: Whenever you do not identify the Boundaries, use size XS.

Notes: Bellow we have more details about boundaries complexity: 

Understanding the boundaries of a backlog item is fundamental to comprehending the information exchanges it involves. This is why this perspective is always considered.

When we identify information exchanges involving the application's screen and/or database, we capture the occurrence of an XS at the boundaries. When we identify that information exchanges cross the digital boundary to physical devices such as printers, scanners, hard drives, sensors, and barcode readers, we capture an S at the boundaries for each device.

Now, when exchanges occur in the digital environment, crossing the boundary with other applications, it's necessary to understand if there can be a transfer of ownership over the information. If the application receiving the information can use it without concern for its validity period, we are dealing with perennial information exchanges, hence an M. On the other hand, if the destination application for the information needs to worry about its validity, not being able to assume ownership over it, we are dealing with volatile information exchanges, and thus we have an XL.

Note that, given the understanding that information exchange occurs at different boundaries, it is necessary to assess the complexity at each of them, including if the information is of distinct natures, perennial and volatile; we consider both complexities.

Finally, when we do not identify any information exchange that crosses boundaries, meaning the backlog item is functional but has no interaction with the screen, database, physical devices, or other applications, it means that it is self-contained. With this, we identify only one XS in the boundary perspective.

# user:
Based on the story in three double quotes below, identify all the Boundaries as per the Boundaries definition provided and identify their complexity. 

Use the following description template to format for each boundary identified:
```json

  "Boundaries": <sequential number>
  "Summary": <summary that identifies the boundaries>
  "Total Elements": <total number of boundaries>
  "Size": <complexity size>
  "Points": <points corresponding to the complexity size>

```

If non-existent, provide a description explaining that no boundaries were identified.

### Result Format:

The output must be in a valid JSON, following format:

```json
